Software Requirements

Vision:
Web-Wizard is an extension that will allow users to take creative control of the websites they visit, by giving them the tools to adjust CSS how they see fit.
People without an understanding of CSS/HTML will be able to not only style sites however they'd like, but also get some exposure to coding in the process.

Scope:

IN:
-The extension will provide a toolset that allows users to modify various CSS elements.
-Users can save changes they've made to a site, and have them applied when they visit that site in the future
-The extension can be deactivated if the user doesn't want altered CSS.

OUT:
-The user cannot alter the actual CSS of the site (only locally)
-The user cannot alter the HTML or JS of the site.

MVP:
An extension that targets CSS elements: backgroundColor, element Colors, font family, font size, and font color.  
User's will be able to alter these options within the popup menu, and will see the changes live on the site they are viewing.  
Users will be able to save changes they made and recall them upon later viewing.

Stretch Goals:
-Users can share designs with other users
-Additional CSS selectors: flex/grid, orientation

-Additional browser support besides Mozilla (maybe chrome or safari)

Functional Requirements:
-User can install the extension from mozilla marketplace
-User activates the extension and is able to immediately play with CSS editor
-User can save their changes

Non-functional Requirements:
-Easy to use (Users can easily understand how the extension works and be able to utilize it quickly
-Easy to install (Users should be able to find and install the extension from Mozilla's marketplace with relative ease)
-Fun to play with
